# Example Configuration for PPT Batch Image Inserter
# This file demonstrates how to configure batch image insertion

# Path to the PowerPoint presentation
# Can be absolute or relative to where you run the script
presentation: "presentations/my_presentation.pptx"

# Template slide to copy (0-based index)
# Slide 2 in PowerPoint UI = index 1
template_slide: 1

# Slides to preserve (not delete) - 0-based indices
# Default: [0, template_slide] (keeps title slide and template)
# Example: [0, 1, 2] to keep slides 1, 2, and 3
preserve_slides: [0, 1]

# Auto-detect image position from the first image in the template slide
# Set to false to manually specify position below
auto_position: true

# Manual position (only used if auto_position is false)
# Uncomment and set values if you want to override auto-detection
# position:
#   left: 0.5      # inches from left edge
#   top: 1.0       # inches from top edge
#   width: 8.0     # image width in inches
#   height: 6.0    # image height in inches

# Base directory containing all images
# All image paths below are relative to this directory
base_dir: "data/images"

# List of image filenames (each creates a new slide)
# Images are processed in the order listed
# The first image should already be in your template slide (slide 2)
images:
  - metric_001_baseline.png
  - metric_002_treatment_a.png
  - metric_003_treatment_b.png
  - metric_004_comparison.png
  - metric_005_statistical_analysis.png

# Notes:
# - Use forward slashes (/) in paths, even on Windows
# - Or use double backslashes (\\) on Windows: "C:\\Users\\Name\\Data"
# - All images must exist in base_dir or the script will skip them with an error
# - Images are processed in the order listed
# - Add or remove filenames as needed
