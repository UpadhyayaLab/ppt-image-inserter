# Example Configuration - Basic Usage
# This demonstrates a simple batch image insertion workflow

# Path to the PowerPoint presentation (relative or absolute)
presentation: "presentations/my_presentation.pptx"

# Template slide to copy (0-based index)
# Slide 2 in PowerPoint UI = index 1
template_slide: 1

# Slides to preserve (not delete) - 0-based indices
# Default: [0, template_slide]
preserve_slides: [0, 1]  # Keeps title slide and template slide

# Backup directory for automatic backups (optional)
# Default: backups/ folder next to the presentation file
# backup_dir: "custom/backup/location"

# Auto-detect image position from the first image in the template slide
# Set to false to manually specify position below
auto_position: true

# Manual position (only used if auto_position is false)
# Uncomment and set values if you want to override auto-detection
# position:
#   left: 0.5      # inches from left edge
#   top: 1.0       # inches from top edge
#   width: 8.0     # image width in inches
#   height: 6.0    # image height in inches

# Base directory containing all images
base_dir: "data/images"

# List of image filenames
# Supports both single images (one per slide) and multiple images (on one slide)
images:
  - metric_001_baseline.png                           # Single image = one slide
  - [metric_002_a.png, metric_002_b.png]              # Two images = one slide
  - metric_003_treatment_b.png                        # Single image = one slide
  - [metric_004_a.png, metric_004_b.png, metric_004_c.png]  # Three images = one slide
  - metric_005_statistical_analysis.png               # Single image = one slide

# Multi-image notes:
# - For multi-image slides, template slide must have N placeholder images
#   (e.g., 2 placeholder images for side-by-side comparison)
# - Positions are auto-detected from template placeholders
# - Number of images in list must match number of placeholders in template
# - Text labels are disabled for multi-image slides to avoid clutter

# General notes:
# - Use forward slashes (/) in paths, even on Windows
# - All images must exist in base_dir or will be skipped with an error
# - Images are processed in the order listed
